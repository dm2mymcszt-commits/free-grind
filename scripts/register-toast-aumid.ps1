.SYNOPSIS
    Registers Free Grind's AppUserModelID so Windows toasts show the app's own
    name and icon instead of "Windows PowerShell".

.DESCRIPTION
    A Windows toast carries no app identity of its own — it carries an
    AppUserModelID (AUMID), and the shell looks that AUMID up to decide which
    name and icon to paint on the notification.

    Installed builds get their AUMID registered by the NSIS/MSI installer, via a
    Start Menu shortcut stamped with System.AppUserModel.ID. A build run straight
    out of src-tauri\target\release has no such shortcut, so upstream's
    notification plugin declines to set an AUMID at all (an unresolvable one makes
    Windows drop the toast silently) and the underlying crate falls back to its
    default: PowerShell's AUMID. Hence "Windows PowerShell" on every toast.

    src-tauri\notification-patched\src\desktop.rs is patched to always set our own
    AUMID. This script supplies the other half — the registration that makes that
    AUMID resolve — by writing the documented shell keys under
    HKCU:\Software\Classes\AppUserModelId\<aumid>.

    Run once per machine. Per-user (HKCU), so no admin rights needed. Toasts sent
    before this is run will not appear at all, since Windows cannot resolve the ID.

.PARAMETER Aumid
    The AppUserModelID to register. Must match "identifier" in
    src-tauri\tauri.conf.json, which is what the plugin stamps on the toast.

.PARAMETER DisplayName
    The name shown on the toast and in Settings > Notifications.

.PARAMETER IconPath
    Image the toast displays as the app icon. PNG is the safest choice; the shell
    is inconsistent about .ico here.

.PARAMETER Unregister
    Remove the registration instead of creating it.
