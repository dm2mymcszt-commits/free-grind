/**
 * interestViewAutoBlockState.ts — durable, account-scoped memory of which
 * Interest views the auto-blocker has already evaluated.
 *
 * The scanner used to keep this in a `useRef<Map>` that was cleared on mount
 * and on every requested rescan, so enabling the feature, restarting the app
 * or merely saving the block rules re-evaluated (and blocked) every profile
 * already sitting in the Interest list. This module is the durable
 * replacement, and it answers exactly one question: "is this a view I have
 * not handled yet?"
 *
 * Two mechanisms, deliberately both:
 * - a **watermark**: the newest view timestamp already evaluated. Anything at
 *   or below it is history. This is what makes the very first activation a
 *   baseline instead of a mass block, and what keeps storage flat no matter
 *   how many viewers exist.
 * - a bounded per-profile **ledger**: the last view time (and view count) we
 *   settled for a profile, so a repeat viewer whose timestamp moves — or
 *   whose count increments without one — is still recognised as new, and an
 *   unchanged view never costs another profile/block API call.
 *
 * Storage is localStorage, keyed per signed-in account, and synchronous on
 * purpose: the live `VIEW_RECEIVED_EVENT` handler has to decide immediately,
 * before the viewer can open a chat.
