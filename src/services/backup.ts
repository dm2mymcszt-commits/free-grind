/**
 * Backup v2 — a device transfer, not just a chat archive.
 *
 * v1 dumped ten tables of the per-account chat database into a single
 * JSON.stringify. That had two problems this format exists to solve:
 *
 *  1. It missed most of what makes two installs look alike. The contact
 *     index (tens of thousands of rows, device-global, in its own sqlite
 *     file), the banked viewer identities in IndexedDB, the block history,
 *     and every localStorage-backed setting — auto-block rules, ghost mode,
 *     whitelist, theme — were all absent. Restoring a v1 file gave you your
 *     messages back and left you re-configuring everything by hand.
 *
 *  2. It could not physically write a large account. Cached media lives as
 *     base64 TEXT inside sqlite, so a well-used profile is a few hundred
 *     megabytes; building that as one JS string, then a second copy inside a
 *     Blob, exhausts the webview before a byte reaches disk.
 *
 * So v2 is NDJSON: a header line, then one self-describing line per row.
 * Both directions stream — the exporter pages each table and hands off
 * batches, the importer decodes the file in chunks — so peak memory is a
 * page, not an account. Rows are grouped into sections the user can pick
 * from, which is what makes a settings-only sync a few megabytes while a
 * full mirror stays possible.
